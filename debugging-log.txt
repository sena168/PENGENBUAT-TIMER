# Debugging Log for PENGENBUAT TIMER

## Date: 2025-11-21
## Time: 12:00-13:10 (UTC+7)

## Initial Status
- Task: Execute prompts from prompt-list.md one at a time
- Starting with 5 unfinished prompts in the list

## Prompt 1: Theme Selector Text Color Consistency
### Issue: Text color in theme selector not consistent with main window
### Analysis: 
- The .theme-dropdown element was using CSS variables but didn't have explicit color property
- Border separators were using hardcoded #ecf0f1 instead of theme variables
- Hover effects were using hardcoded colors instead of theme variables
### Solution:
- Added color: var(--text) to .theme-dropdown class
- Changed border-bottom to use color-mix(in srgb, var(--text) 10%, transparent)
- Updated hover effect to use theme-appropriate color

### Later revision based on user feedback:
- Removed all dynamic CSS variable formatting
- Applied fixed "Ocean Deep" theme colors to all theme selector elements:
  - .theme-dropdown: background #34495e, text #ecf0f1, border #3b4c60
  - .theme-option: text #ecf0f1, separator based on fixed color
  - Hover effect: based on fixed color #1abc9c

## Prompt 2: Font Check in styles.css
### Issue: Check if fonts are functioning, remove unused ones
### Analysis:
- Found font import: Roboto Mono (used in body, buttons, inputs)
- Found font import with multiple fonts: Exo 2, Poppins, Questrial, Rubik, Baloo 2, Orbitron, Comfortaa, Nunito Sans
- Chivo Mono and Nunito were imported but not used anywhere
### Solution:
- Removed unused fonts (Chivo Mono and Nunito) from the import

## Prompt 3: Random Title Configuration
### Issue: Ensure random title functionality works according to random-title-config.js
### Analysis:
- random-title-config.js contains possible titles and update interval
- script-logic.js uses this configuration properly
- The functionality was already implemented correctly
### Solution:
- Verified the implementation was working properly

## Prompt 4: Title Change Every Minute
### Issue: Check if title changes every minute whether counting or not
### Analysis:
- Found that titles were changing every 5 minutes (300000ms) based on config
- setInterval(updateRandomTitle, updateInterval) was implemented correctly
### Solution:
- Changed default interval from 300000ms (5 minutes) to 60000ms (1 minute)

## Prompt 5: Redundancy Check
### Issue: Find redundant code/components
### Analysis:
- Found redundant script.js file with only comments
- Found backup file externals/BACKUPS/random-title-config.js with identical content
- Found outdated documentation random-title-data.md not used by app
- Found "(Current)" text issue in theme selector (already fixed in previous work)
### Solution:
- Reported all redundancies to user

## Additional Issues Discovered and Fixed:
### Theme Selector Conditional Formatting
- Found that theme selector was using CSS variables that changed with active theme
- Each option was using different colors based on current theme
- User requested to remove all dynamic formatting
- Applied fixed "Ocean Deep" theme colors to all theme selector elements

### Hover Effect Consistency
- Hover effect was using hardcoded color instead of theme-appropriate color
- Fixed to use theme-based color initially, then fixed to use fixed color per user request

## Final Status
- All 5 prompts from prompt-list.md completed
- Theme selector now uses fixed formatting with consistent colors
- Font imports cleaned up to remove unused fonts
- Title changes every minute as requested
- Redundant files identified
- CSS variables removed from theme selector as per user request
