PROMPT LIST:

A RULES:
Always follow these rules when using this prompt list.

Execute the prompts sequentially, one at a time. Mark a prompt as completed only after fully executing it and confirming success.

When the user instructs you to proceed, select the next unmarked prompt from the list and begin execution. Mark it as completed only upon full completion. and move to the FINISHED PROMPT section.

Do not initiate or re-execute any prompt that is already marked as completed.

All prompts in this list are secondary in priority to direct user instructions; pause or override as needed for immediate user requests.

All prompts within this priority list take precedence over all other documents and instructions. When conflicts arise, modify other documents to align with the directives in this list as needed. Procedure: Identify and highlight differences between this prompt list and other documents; present options for resolution; confirm with the user which elements to retain or update; apply changes to the prompt list or documents based on user selection; if no user response is provided, maintain the priority and integrity of this list.

Log the source of each commenced prompt, indicating whether it originated directly from the user or from this list.

Format unmarked prompts as bullets (-); convert to numbered list items after successfully commencing them.

Utilize the provided previous conversation context as necessary for informed execution.

after each completion also update logs, plans, and other docs related.

do one prompt each time then report when finished and ask user if you can continue or polish the result of last prompt.

user will update this from time to time so check thoroughly each time.

do not use credentials as global always use per project as I might be running multiple instances of development at once with different credentials.
